  'was based on Deinonychus, a much larger and more terrifying creature. But the name Velociraptor was more ' ||
  'dramatic and easier to say, and a star was born. Thanks to its star turn, Velociraptor is one of the most famous non-bird dinosaurs in the world. This Hollywood star also has many features that mark it as a close relative of modern birds. The bird-like traits of Velociraptor included hinged ankles, swivel-jointed wrists, and a furcula, or wishbone. The animalâ€™s feet are bird-like, too, with three forward-facing toesâ€”though a horny sheath would have covered the toe and finger bones you see, doubling their size. Living birds and reptilesâ€”as well as non-bird dinosaursâ€”also have a bony ring in each eye socket. Velociraptor was covered in thin filaments, and the feathers on its tail and forearms would look right at home on a living bird, though this animal was flightless. Velociraptor was a fierce predator, chasing prey on two legs. But even this behavior is bird-like; most birds spend more time walking than flying, and only a few catch prey on the wing.',
